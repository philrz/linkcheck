Now let's suppose we need to add a constant to each coordinate point. To do this, we will see a variation of the **over** operator called the **["scoped" over](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/language/operators/over#:~:text=The%20nested%20subquery,outer%20query%27s%20table.)**. It will create a sub-sequence of values for each array it encounters. That sequence can be operated on just like any other sequence of values. Having the scope is useful because the sub-sequence can be collected back up into a single array value. Take a look.
